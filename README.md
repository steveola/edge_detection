# edge_detection
A Very simple edge detection package in Javascript using the HTML Canvas.
## How it works!
I works by comoputing the difference between the a pixel with its next pixel horizontally and verticall, the places a point it differents are much(set value in the code). So simple to easy but bigger algorithms coming soon so enable practical AI.

Modify, Enjoy!
